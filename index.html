              Hi friends! My name is 3x3, and I am the original Rubik's Cube.
              Thus making me the most original of them all. I was born in 1974
              in Budapest, Hungary and I have a total of 6 faces/sides, giving
              me a total of 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 permutations! :D

              4x4, 5x5, Megaminx...just about every cube is in some
              shape or form a derivation of me! Every cube simplifies to a 3x3.

              My initial learning curve is always intimidating. But really, anyone
              can solve the Rubik's Cube if they have the patience and know how to count.

                If you thought you were done solving the 3x3, wait till you see me,
                a bigger and badder version! I was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1981 and have
                6 faces, except with an extra layer, giving me a total of 7.4 x 10^45 permutations! But
                don't worry, I am solved like a 3x3, except with an extra step, like many other
                big cubes!

                Hello World! I'm Grant, a speedcuber from SoCal, student at UC Berkeley, and
                the creator of this website! I still remember picking up my first cube in
                3rd grade and falling in love with this intricate puzzle. There is some magic when I
                place all six colors in their correct spots: the crisp feeling turning each piece swiftly.
                Since learning how to solve a 3x3, I've challenged myself to solve many other puzzles
                as highlighted on this website and also become a speedcube competitor. My favorite
                competition experience was at the Rubik's Cube World Championships in Brazil in 2015! I got
                the opportunity to meet a ton of amazing people and really immerse myself in the incredible cubing community.
                My goal is to continue spreading my passion for cubing to others. Solving a Rubik's Cube
                really doesn't take a high IQ, it just takes patience and a willingness/passion to learn. I
                hope you can discover interest through my website, and thank you for visiting!
